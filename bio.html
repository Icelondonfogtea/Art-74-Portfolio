        WHO AM I: I'm Minghui Kong, or you can call me Kyle, male, born in 2000, born in China, but my current nationality is the United States. Iâ€™m a college student of SJSU and majoring in Pictorial Art.
      </p>
      <p>More About ME: I like some imaginary existence and unrealistic things, and I try to create them with a paintbrush. My usual hobbies are reading, drawing, and playing computer games. Reading is mainly to pass the time at ordinary times, mainly reading some science fiction or some light novels. I think time passes quickly when reading. Although reading while lying down is not good for my eyes, I still like it because it's very comfortable. Painting started my self-study two years ago, and it can be regarded as my main interest, so basically I only paint on electronic devices such as iPad or tablet, and I will draw one or two pictures every week, although it mainly focuses on animation and human body lines or drawings. I play computer games more miscellaneous, in addition to music games, basically have to play, this is absolutely not because my sense of rhythm is a very poor reason not to play, absolutely not! I like to play games that many people can play together because you can play with friends.
